            <h1>Tech For Kids: Game Development with Python</h1>
            <p>On December 26, 2023, I proudly concluded my journey in the Tech for Kids' Game Development with Python course. It was an incredibly enjoyable experience filled with creativity and learning. Throughout the course, I was able to explore the fascinating world of game development, and each session brought new challenges and opportunities to enhance my skills.
                One of the highlights of my time in the course was my final project, where I worked hard to apply everything I had learned. I’m thrilled to share that I managed to stand out among my peers and was recognized as the top student for my project! This accomplishment not only validated my efforts but also boosted my confidence in my abilities.
                As I look ahead, I can't help but feel excited about the prospect of continuing my journey in Python game development. There are so many concepts and techniques still to explore, and I am eager to dive deeper into the world of programming.
                I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to Tech for Kids for providing such an enriching program. The support, resources, and community they fostered made this experience truly remarkable. I am looking forward to applying the skills I have gained and creating even more games in the future!

                <h1>Start Up: 3rd Place on Examination Achievement</h1>
                <p>After all my hard work and commitment, I ended up snagging 3rd place in the exam, which was both a relief and a source of pride for me. I had dedicated countless hours to studying, often sacrificing my free time and social activities to ensure I was fully prepared. The late nights spent poring over textbooks, the endless practice tests, and the moments of self-doubt all culminated in this achievement.

                    When the results were finally announced, I felt a rush of emotions—excitement, anxiety, and a sense of accomplishment. Securing 3rd place not only validated my efforts but also motivated me to continue striving for excellence in my academic pursuits. It was a reminder that perseverance pays off, and I couldn't help but feel grateful for the support of my friends and family who encouraged me along the way.
                    
                    This experience has taught me the importance of resilience and determination, and I look forward to applying these lessons in future challenges. While I may not have taken the top spot, I know that this achievement is just one step on my journey, and I am eager to see where my hard work will lead me next.
